Dronos
======

Dronos is a distributed scheduling system (with patterns similar to Linux's cron
system), using MongoDB to coordinate running tasks (drons) across multiple
nodes.


Coming soon!
======

Dronos is currently part of a larger system and isn't portable/reusable/etc. We
are in the process of modularizing Dronos to make it publicly available. This is
a very rough first draft of the modularized version of the code and has not been
tested at all.

The next step in the process will be to write mocha tests. Check back in a
couple weeks, and everything should be ready for production (beta at least).
